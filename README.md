= Spree Simple Blog

Adds a simple blog to Spree which works much like Toto (http://github.com/cloudhead/toto/), reading text files in /content/articles. Content files consist of
yaml metadata followed by Markdown content.

By extending FileModel, other types of content can be managed in the same way way.
